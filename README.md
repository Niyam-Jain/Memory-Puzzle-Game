# Memory Puzzle Game

This is a memory puzzle game built using Python's turtle graphics module. The objective of the game is to match pairs of tiles by flipping them over.

## Features

- Simple and intuitive gameplay.
- Colorful graphical user interface.
- Randomized tile placement for each game session.
- Interactive clicking mechanism to flip tiles.
- Real-time updates and feedback during gameplay.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Turtle graphics module

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or copy the code into your local environment.
2. Install the required dependencies, if not already installed.
3. Run the script using a Python interpreter.

```bash
python memory_puzzle_game.py
```

## Instructions

1. Upon running the script, a turtle graphics window will open with a grid of tiles.
2. Each tile contains a hidden number from 0 to 31.
3. Your goal is to flip over pairs of tiles to reveal their hidden numbers and find matching pairs.
4. To flip a tile, click on it using the mouse.
5. If two flipped tiles have the same number, they will remain face up.
6. If two flipped tiles have different numbers, they will be flipped back face down.
7. Continue flipping tiles until all pairs have been matched.
8. The game is completed when all tiles are face up.

## Example

Here's an example of how to play the memory puzzle game:

1. Run the script and the turtle graphics window will open.
2. Click on two tiles to flip them over.
3. If the tiles have the same number, they will stay face up.
4. If the tiles have different numbers, they will be flipped back face down.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until all pairs have been matched and all tiles are face up.
